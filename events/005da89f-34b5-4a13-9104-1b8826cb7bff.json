  "description": "Pentagame is a new abstract board game. We talk about some fundamental insights.\nPentagame is a novel board game that gains popularity in nerd circles. We have gathered insights regarding the game and will talk about(1) the game as such: how we came to invent it, and how it is played(2) a possible antique ancestor(3) opening moves and theory(4) state space complexity(5) endings and end positionsThis is a hot topic, since Pentagame remains an unsolved game. Studying it is an exercise in the theory of abstract games. The talk should be interesting for Pentagame players, but also to anyone interested in the theory of games.We are looking forward for discussion, intellectual exchange, and collaboration.Note that Pentagame can be played at c-base assembly pretty much any time, and from 22:00 hrs per day in particular.There will be an open tournament on the young hacker day.",
