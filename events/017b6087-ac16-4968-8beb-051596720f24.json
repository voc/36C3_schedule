I'm Eunha from Korea. Korea has the one of the most variety of seaweed. Traditionally we enjoy the seafood and seaweed. For examnple after you (only women case) have a birth you should eat miyoek (''[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wakame Undaria pinnatifida]'') for a while because the iodine makes the woman after birth the blood clean and her womb shrinks quickly. You can see and enjoy the several eatable seaweed in my workshop \"hacked\" with traditional Korean [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bibimbap bibimbab]. Through this workshop i hope you have more interests in sea and nature. Thanks.This workshop is based at donations at your will no one turned away for lack of funds.",
