I am passionate about group dynamics as well as collective learning processes.   \r\nIt is fascinating, how simple techniques and frameworks can change the way people perceive each other and how they interact. It does not need super complicated knowledge or skills to change team work and make our interaction become aware, trustful and considerate. The simplicity I discovered is what thrives me to share my experiences and learn also about yours. Looking forward to meet you!",
