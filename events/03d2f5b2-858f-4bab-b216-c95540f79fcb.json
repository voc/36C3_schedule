As more and more parts in an economy seem to become quantified and qualified, a new monitoring system for sustainable development will be installed. But how do people thought to measure sustainability?Starting in the 19th century with forest-management, we will talk about a systems perspective on sustainability, as well as the triple and quadruble bottom lines. While it is certain that we need to develop more sustainable computer systems, this is the time to talk about how we conceive sustainability and to reflect on what this will mean for future free software systems.Malte Rei\u00dfig is currently research associate at the Institute for Advanced Sustainability Studies e.V. and since 2008 free software developer with the dmx-platform \"for collaboration and knowledge management\".",
