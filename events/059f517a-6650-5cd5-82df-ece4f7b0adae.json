  "description": "After the highly-successful presentation \"Toll of personal privacy in 2018\" at Chaos-West 35C3 where I talked about my personal experiences with trying to protect my privacy, this year I return with a completely* different talk that tries to convince the audience \u2014 you should care about privacy too!\r\n\r\nThis talk revisits the theme of personal privacy in the digital world, this time centring around the \"I've got nothing to hide\" argument. A beam of intensive light is shed upon the motivation behind caring about one's privacy. We go in depth into what we can do to stay private and should we even try to do it at all. We talk about where we as an global society were able to fix privacy and where we have failed. New topics previously not covered are discussed, such as herd immunity and certification programs.\r\n\r\n\\* 97%+",
