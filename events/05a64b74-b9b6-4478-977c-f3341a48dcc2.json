  "description": "\nArch Linux is a distribution created in 2002 that focuses on user centrality. It's a do-it-yourself distribution that provides a minimal base set of packages to let the user build on.The intentions of the meetup is to have a few short 20 minute talks, and then some community discussions. Members from Arch team will participate. Last year we had a completely packed room, and it doesn't look like it will be better this year :)If there is anything you want to do, feel free to email foxboron@archlinux.org",
