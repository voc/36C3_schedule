  "description": "Paradigms from the open source / free software community are increasingly being applied in the hardware domain, but at the moment everyone relies strongly on proprietary chips. Open source chip design is a challenge and opportunity. I will give an overview about previous and current related projects, explain how the chip development cycle works, what the barriers to open source chips are, why we need open source chips, who will benefit, and how you can get involved. There will also be room for discussion and connecting.\n",
