This interactive lecture aims to provide you with basic information on the subject of discrimination and violence in the event and party context. There will be space for examination of one's own experiences intended to sensitize you to the topic of potential problems and designate one's own field of power and motivation to change structures towards a more attentive celebration culture. Why? - to strengthen us in our pro-actions and re-actions, to give suggestions and to open a space for ideas and opportunities for change. The overall objective is to contribute to a longer-term sensitization of the event industry and an implementation of awareness as a crucial part of future events. It is a space for difficult and uncomfortable conversations to occur in a safe and friendly atmosphere.",
