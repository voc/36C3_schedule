Nevertheless, FOSS is still \r\nrather the exception than the rule for the majority of scientific domains.\r\nIn this session we will discuss the state of FOSS within the various European \r\nscientific communities. Based on this we will try to identify stakeholders, \r\ncommon goals and potential policy proposals.",
