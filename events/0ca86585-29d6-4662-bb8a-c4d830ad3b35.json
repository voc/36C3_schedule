  "abstract": "Xbox 360 video game console had a number of widely known hacks for firmware of its optical disc drives. However, it was never the case with Blu-ray disc drives of Sony PlayStation video game consoles. In fact, up until recently there was no much information available on this subject publicly.",
  "description": "In this presentation, I would like to share my journey of delving deep into internals and security of Sony PlayStation Blu-ray disc drives. As games are distributed within optical media, those embedded devices were intended to contain the best security possible. I will demonstrate a multiple hardware hacks and several software vulnerabilities that allowed to dump firmware and get code execution on multiple models of Sony PlayStation Blu-ray disc drives.\r\n\r\nIn this presentation, I will share the following:\r\n1)\tI will provide in-depth analysis of vulnerabilities and their exploitation to achieve code execution on multiple models of Sony PlayStation Blu-ray disc drives\r\n2)\tI will discuss problems that I\u2019ve encountered while reverse engineering the firmware and how I solved (some of) them\r\n3)\tI will talk about security features of Sony PlayStation Blu-ray disc drives\r\n4)\tI will explain what engineers did right and how achieving code execution on the drive doesn\u2019t lead to full compromise of security",
