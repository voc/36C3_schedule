  "description": "Our so-called networked society has failed so far to transpose the logic of interconnectedness into our lives. Citizens are becoming increasingly machine-like and dependent on data, threatening the connection between humans and their natural habitats. Although most of our daily transactions are carried out through electronic devices, we know very little of the apparatus that facilitates such interactions, or in other words, about the factory that lies beyond the interface. In this talk, artist Joana Moll will try to trace the connection between interfaces, patriarchy, intimacy, data, language, IT business models, free labour, surveillance, CO2 and domesticated electricity.",
