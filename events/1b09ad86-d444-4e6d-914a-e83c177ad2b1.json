  "description": "An overview to writing and studying Japanese from zero to native comprehension.\nThis is for everyone eager to get started in Japanese reading and writing or get a few ideas on how to improve.No knowledge of Japanese required, we will start from scratch.What we'll discuss:   * What Japanese writing is made up of und which symbols are used for what purposes.   * The most basic Japanese symbols, Hiragana and Katakana and try writing a few ourselves while also experiencing the ridiculously simple pronunciation. With that we can already read our first few words.   * How to study Japanese in general   * Why adults have a hard time reading texts made for children and why Japanese writing is a huge mess   * The next step would be studying around 2000 Kanji, but we will just try writing a few, talk about the wacky world of reading Japanese texts with Kanji and how they are a complete mess and close the Workshop with looking at a method to get them into your head within half a year. The presented method for studying Kanji will be the Heisig method using koohii and Anki for best results in properly understanding the Kanji.After this course and a few more minutes-hours of studying you will be ready to read a few easy Japanese children's books.",
