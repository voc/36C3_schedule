  "description": "An overview to writing and studying Japanese from zero to native comprehension.\nThis is for everyone eager to get started in Japanese reading and writing or get a few ideas on how to improve.      No knowledge of Japanese required, we will start from scratch. '''Please bring a pen and some paper to try some writing.'''      What we'll discuss:   * What Japanese writing is made up of und which symbols are used for what purposes.   * The most basic Japanese symbols, Hiragana and Katakana and try writing a few ourselves while also experiencing the ridiculously simple pronunciation. With that we can already read our first few words.   * How to study Japanese in general   * Why adults have a hard time reading texts made for children and why Japanese writing is a huge mess   * The next step would be studying around 2000 Kanji, but we will just try writing a few, talk about the wacky world of reading Japanese texts with Kanji and how they are a complete mess and close the Workshop with looking at a method to get them into your head within half a year. The presented method for studying Kanji will be the Heisig method using koohii and Anki for best results in properly understanding the Kanji.   After this course and a few more minutes-hours of studying you will be ready to read a few easy Japanese children's books.      Useful stuff:* search for \"Hiragana Chart\" or \"Katakana Chart\" or \"Hiragana chart stroke order\" or \"Katakana chart stroke order\" to get all sorts of useful charts* Recommended Textbooks for studying Japanese: \"Genki I\" and \"Genki II\"* a detailed explanation of the Heisig method to study all the Kanji and an introduction to using Anki to do that. There is also a deck there to download with the best koohii stories up to 2015, but it needs some adjustments to be really useful: https://nihongoshark.com/learn-kanji/* Anki's website: https://apps.ankiweb.net/ for Android look for AnkiDroid and for iOS look for AnkiMobile (or something like that)* Kanji deck from above post from NihongoShark.com: https://ankiweb.net/shared/info/1956010956* Kanji deck from NihongoShark with adjustments as I would study them (only Kanji to meaning, no information that is too much): https://megastore.uni-augsburg.de/get/E27FHb56Fe/* the koohii Community: https://kanji.koohii.com/ (<- not a page I used or visit, but that's where the stories are from for the deck)* Tae Kim's Complete Guide to Japanese: http://www.guidetojapanese.org/learn/complete/ <- also pretty nice, I read through this one (on my phone, there is an android app of it) after finishing Genki I and Genki IIIf anything you wanted to see here is missing, write me an e-mail: alex.m.s@gmx.de",
