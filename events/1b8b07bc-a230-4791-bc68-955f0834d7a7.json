  "description": "Try out a mechanical keyboard or show off your collection and chat with like-minded keyclackers.\nOver recent years quality input hardware has gained popularity harking back to a time where computers regularly cost 5 figures and manufacturers weren't trying to save every penny using mushy rubberdomes and flimsy keycaps for key input peripherals.The modular design of mechanical keyswitches leaves room for countless customisation options like custom layouts or just nicer looking keycaps, or enabling to build specialized keypads using custom controllers and open firmware.This meetup is meant to appreciate the technology and provide grounds for people to try out a mechanical keyboard for the first time or show off their collection and chat with like-minded individuals.",
