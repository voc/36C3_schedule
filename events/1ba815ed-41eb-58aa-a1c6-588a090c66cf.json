  "description": "To make our ecological and technological work effective and unique, many work-quanta should be developed in advance of any public offering. The unit-of-work is the minimum weekly shared computational processing required to sustain the network. A completed unit-of-work represents a proof-of-human-collaboration, the consensus algorithm for access to the action network.",
