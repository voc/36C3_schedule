  "description": "Flipdots are electromechnical displays that were often used in public transport vehicles.\r\nWith the Fluepdot project, it is possible to take control over this ancient technology, to built a large installation.\r\nIn this talk, I will give an insight on how this thing came to live. Also I will be answering the most frequently asked questions, give an overview of the electrical engineering and the software used to control the installation.",
