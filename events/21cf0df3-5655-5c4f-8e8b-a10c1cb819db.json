  "description": "Today, up to half of all animal species are at risk of extinction. At the same time, leading engineers and philosophers are envisioning a bio- and geo-engineered future where machines may develop their own forms of consciousness. What may seem to be two distinct developments \u2013 of nature and IT \u2013 are in fact the consequences of the actions of the one species that has come to dominate the planet: homo sapiens. As an artist, I have always striven to find the worlds that are hidden behind the ordinary. In my lecture performance I use photography, a dead bird, a children's vinyl published by state environmental education services of native bird's songs (which are extinct by now), show results of my own Artificial Intelligence, which continues evolution of moths and let a bionic drone fly. Anthropogenic Extinction Crisis, bionic engineering, climate change, and AI will be put into a mesmerizing web of inter-relations, using art as a medium of research, turning complex information into visual messages.",
