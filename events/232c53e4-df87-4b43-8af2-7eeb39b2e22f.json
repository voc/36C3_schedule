Learn in this hands-on workshop how to use it. Git is useful both for personal files and for files which are edited by teams.\nPlease install Git before the workshop starts. :-)* On Windows:  [https://git-scm.com/download/win Git for Windows]* On Linux: apt install git (or similar)* On Mac: brew install gitNote to organizers of other sessions: We don't need that much space that M3 provides. If you want to organize a session which needs the space more than us then we'll surely find a solution! Call me at +49 176 95110311 (German or English).",
