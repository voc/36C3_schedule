  "description": "In March 2019 i attended the mainline workshop of the center for applied rationality. I'm happy to help you understand what their workshops offer and give you a speedrun through their methods on how to be more productive and change your behaviour effectively. Here a text from their website www.rationality.org\r\n\r\nCFAR exists to try to make headway in this domain\u2014the domain of understanding how human cognition already works, in practice, such that we can then start the process of making useful changes, such that we will be better positioned to solve the problems that really matter. We are neither about pure research nor pure execution, but about applied rationality\u2014the middle ground where the rubber hits the road, where one\u2019s models meet reality, and where one\u2019s ideas and plans either pay off (or they don\u2019t). By looking in-depth at individual case studies, advances in cogsci research, and the data and insights from our thousand-plus workshop alumni, we\u2019re slowly building a robust set of tools for truth-seeking, introspection, self-improvement, and navigating intellectual disagreement\u2014and we\u2019re turning that toolkit on itself with each iteration, to try to catch our own flawed assumptions and uncover our own blindspots and mistakes.",
