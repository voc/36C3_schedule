  "description": "Badge Magic is a project born out of the desire to open up LED mini badges and reprogram them with an open source solution with features not found elsewhere. In recent versions we added a lot of features like drawing of cliparts and additional language support. Through an Android phone the user can add scrolling symbols and text on LED name badges through Bluetooth. The app provides options to portray names, clipart and simple animations on LED badges.",
