  "description": "In this session we will discuss the state of FOSS within the various European  scientific communities.\nThe principles of Free and Open Source Software (FOSS) are well aligned with the core tenets of science, i.e., the sharing of knowledge and the demand for reproducibility of results. Nevertheless, FOSS is still  rather the exception than the rule for the majority of scientific domains. In this session we will discuss the state of FOSS within the various European  scientific communities. Based on this we will try to identify stakeholders,  common goals and potential policy proposals.",
