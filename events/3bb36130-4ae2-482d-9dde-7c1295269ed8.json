  "description": "Join with your derpy bot to fight your nemesis! Push it off the table or knock the enemy over. No weapons. No advanced controllers. No tears. Don't take it serious. \r\n\r\nEveryone is invited to compete with a self-made robot, especially if you've never done that before. High-tech is penalized, creativity encouraged. \r\n\r\nIf you are interested, please send me a quick \"sounds cool, maybe i'll build one\" mail to honky@defendtheplanet.net or contact @honky in RocketChat.\r\n\r\nWe need at least 8 Robots to participate, if we have more, we'll bring this to the battlefield.",
