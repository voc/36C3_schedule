  "abstract": "The Namecoin and Tor developers are running a new experiment: the GNU/Linux Nightly Builds of Tor Browser now have optional support for resolving Namecoin's .bit domains.  This experiment aims to provide a fix for the long-standing UX problem with .onion domains: the lack of human-meaningful names.  With Namecoin, you can access onion services via nice, memorable addresses like http://federalistpapers.bit/ instead of http://7fa6xlti5joarlmkuhjaifa47ukgcwz6tfndgax45ocyn4rixm632jid.onion/ .  In this workshop, you'll be able to try it out yourself.  Bring a GNU/Linux machine (bare-metal or VM are both fine).  After the demo, I'd love your feedback on what our next steps should be in this area.",
  "description": "I highly recommend attending my talk \"Adventures and Experiments Adding Namecoin to Tor Browser\" prior to this workshop, but this is not a hard requirement; attendees who didn't attend that talk are still welcome.\r\n\r\nDisclaimer: Although the work covered in this workshop is a collaboration between Namecoin and Tor, this workshop is solely from Namecoin's perspective.",
