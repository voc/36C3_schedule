  "description": "The 21st century will be powered by electricity. I'm a journalist in the field of science and technology reporting. I followed the development of electricity storage and generation for over 10 years. In this talk I will outline the current state of electricity storage technology and its limitations. There is a gap between the intermittent availability of electricity generation and demand for it.\r\n\r\nCobalt and Lithium are increasingly limited in supply and their production is often produced using unsustainable means. Alternatives are being development and will be presented. Some of these technologies are in the form of chemical batteries and some use very surprisingly simple technologies.\r\n\r\nI will be giving an introduction into future technologies for electricity storage currently in development. Some of these are batteries without rare materials and others are not batteries at all.",
