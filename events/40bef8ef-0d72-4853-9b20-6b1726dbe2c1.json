  "description": "Can we transition Bitcoin to a Post-Quantum World? In this talk, I present the basic principles Quantum Computers rely on to perform certain calculations much faster than classical computers. I will give a beginner\u2019s explanation to some quantum algorithms that can undermine Bitcoin\u2019s security and show how they can be used to hijack transactions. Finally, I describe a protocol that can be deployed in Bitcoin to allow users to securely transition their funds to quantum resistance even in the presence of a quantum computer!\n",
