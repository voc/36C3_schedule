  "description": "This documentary takes a look at hacking beyond the computer screens. In the place were technology and activists meet. Where the need to circumvent state surveillance and surveillance capitalism is grave. Where people see an unfair system in society and find a way to hack it. This is the true hacker habitat.\r\n\r\nIn direct opposition to banks, corporations and entrepreneurs who appropriated the words \u2018hack/hackathon\u2019, the film aims to fill these expressions with the subversive and anarchist tradition they originally contained. Delivered in a chapter form, this film shows hacker projects and system hacking from Japan, Cuba, occupied Western Sahara, Belgium and Sweden. These chapters are intertwined with thoughtprovoking interviews where hackers talk about the ethics behind what they do. Furthermore, the film mirrors these ideas in a discussion with the political theorist Emma Goldman\u2019s writings. Filmed under the 2010s it provides an unique insight into a global political hacker movement.",
