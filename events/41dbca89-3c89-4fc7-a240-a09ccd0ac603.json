  "description": "Learning Somatic safety, feel what you want, playfully meet people with honesty\nI will offer some tools and excercises to learn how to feel safe and empowered within ourselves and in a group, to listen to our subconscious/ body/ intuition about what feels good or not.  With these tools, there is then a chance to come in contact in playful, honest and connecting ways that shows your compatibility much more than the usual awkward small talk.I Greg have been a connection and presence geek for many years and is now combining his new tools from Embodied Intimacy and Pelvic Heart Integration trainings.  He helps people feel relaxed and landed in their bodies, and holds space for emotional exploration and release.  He is currently offering deep cuddling sessions in Berlin, besides electronics engineering, conscious kink and dance explorationHeld in English with German translation as needed",
