  "description": "What formula made email outlive it's contenders until now? What recent innovations are making it hip again? And what economic model could bring a renaissance of decentralised, Free Software messaging on the multi-billion user scale?\nHundreds of messaging platforms have launched and failed over the last 50 years. One has grown voraciously, netting 3.8 billion users, and handling 103 trillion messages each year. Like the Internet itself, email is decentralised and censorship resistant by design. It is technically extensible, powered by Free Software, and Open Standards agreed independently by consensus.LinkedIn, Facebook, Google and others are racing to own the future of this space, with Gmail alone accounting for 28% of email opens in 2018, in Western countries. Email's freedom, privacy, and security are taken for granted and under threat. What formula made email outlive it's contenders until now? What recent innovations are making it hip again? And what economic model could bring a renaissance of decentralised, Free Software messaging on the multi-billion user scale?",
