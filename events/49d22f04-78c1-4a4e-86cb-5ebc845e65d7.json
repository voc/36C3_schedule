  "description": "\"I had the pleasure to met Oliotronix in Denmark at the Chipwrecked Festival.\r\nHer set was one of my favorite, a blazing mix of chiptune, circuitbending and DIY culture delivered right on your face as a mega banging rave.\r\nI was blown away when I discovered she was improvising!\r\nCheck it out and follow her FB page and check for her live performances around Europe!\" (IANO, iano.bandcamp.com)\r\n\r\nSince 2017 her new music setup has taken shape in form of energetic performances using Gameboy DMG and various electronic noise machines still combined with an hooligan/techno/electro/rave/core DJ set. Feedback from the audience:\r\n1. \u201cWhat is exciting about DJ Oliotronix is she doesn't follow the trend but deliver crazy sets following her own taste while keeping it entertaining on a high level of intensity. Prepare to have fun!\u201c Madame Claude, Berlin\r\n2. \u201cVery original and eclectic, with interesting non-standard use of equipment!\u201d Galaxy Wolf, London\r\n2. \u201cGreat! Good energy and selection. Nice to see DJs enjoying themselves too!\u201d  Crux, London\u201c",
