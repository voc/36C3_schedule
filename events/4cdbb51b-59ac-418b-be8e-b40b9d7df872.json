  "description": "This talk will explain the basic building blocks of cryptography in a manner that will (hopefully) be understandable by everyone, in particular by a non-technical audience. The talk will not require any understanding of maths or computer science.\r\nThis talk will cover the following topics:\r\n<ul>\r\n  <li>What is encryption and what does it do?</li>\r\n  <li>What are the different kinds of encryption?</li>\r\n  <li>What is authenticity? Are authenticity and encryption related?</li>\r\n  <li>How can authenticity be achieved?</li>\r\n  <li>What are certificates for?</li>\r\n  <li>What is TLS and what does it do?</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nWhile covering the above topcis, I will <em>not</em> explain the technical details of common cryptographic schemes (like RSA, AES, HMAC and so on), in order to avoid keep this talk accessible to a broad audience.",
