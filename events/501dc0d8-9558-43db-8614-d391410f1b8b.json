  "description": "Bringing curtisannes cantine from OpenLab Augsburg to 36C3!\nBringing curtisannes cantine from OpenLab Augsburg to 36C3!...this time we will be baking, though.I'm proud to be able to celebrate my birthday at Congress - so I intend to celebrate with various cakes and Fairy Dust Cookies! If you got a sweet tooth, a weakness for decorating or children who do, feel free to join in curtisannes cake center!The cakes I plan to bake are:- cinnamon rolls with raisins and cream cheese - tarte au chocolate with orange slices - almond apple pie - carrot cake with pecans and almondsFurthermore, I hope there is still time left to prepare a simple cookie dough and decorations. If it doesn't fit in the timeslot on 27th, we may prepare the dough later and bake them during 36C3 anyway.If you have further questions or requests just send me an e-mail: contact@curtisanne.rocks or take a look at the foodhackingbase wiki page: https://foodhackingbase.org/wiki/Ccc36c3See you there!",
