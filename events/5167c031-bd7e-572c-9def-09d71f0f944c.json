  "abstract": "[Sonar](https://github.com/arso-project/sonar) is an in-development p2p database & search engine for grassroots media libraries. We're building atop the [Dat Protocol](https://dat.foundation) stack and connect [hypercores](https://github.com/mafintosh/hypercore) and [hyperdrives](https://github.com/hyperdrives) with a search engine written in [Rust](https://rust-lang.org). In this talk we'll give a quick intro how Sonar works at the moment and which challenges we're facing. Then we want to discuss some of the design choices and how we can create a distributed network of radical media libraries and archives.",
