Going down to sand grain sized 01005 SMD parts, this button is a challenge for experienced \"soldiers\" and those who want to become one.\nThe Binary Kitchen soldering workshop goes 36C3. We are providing a soldering workshop for several and completely different soldering kits. Come and solder with us, an manual and 38 soldering irons.Nibble++ is a simple PCB to test your SMD hand-soldering skills. Going down to sand grain sized 01005 SMD parts, this button is a challenge for experienced \"soldiers\" and those who want to become one. You're free to bring your own device and microscope.Soldering skills are helpful but you can do what you can do. The kit starts with more easy SMD sizes. We don't have a sign up list, just come by and solder (but we just have 38 seats, first come first serve).[[File:nibble-plus-plus.png|600px]]* More information about other Workshops: https://www.binary-kitchen.de/wiki/doku.php?id=veranstaltungen:nibble_area* More information about the Nibble++: https://github.com/Binary-Kitchen/SolderingTutorial/tree/master/NibblePlusPlusSMD",
