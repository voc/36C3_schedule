  "description": "All you need to know if you want to become a Pen&Paper Game Master!\nLoved Stranger Things and now want to kill your own friends with a Demogorgon? But you don't have a group and is it even possible to run a Pen&Paper RPG if you haven't even played in one before? The answer is YES! and this session is all about how to find the right group for you and what to think about before playing so your first campaign will be success and not a post on r/rpghorrorstories. Time for questions included! Note: Session will be in English if any non-German speakers attend but can be held in German if everybody speaks the language. Questions can be asked in either English or German/ Session auf Englisch, falls jemand kein Deutsch spricht, aber auf Deutsch, falls alle die Sprache beherrschen.  Fragen k\u00f6nnen auf Englisch oder Deutsch gestellt werden.",
