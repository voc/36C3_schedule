  "description": "Introduction to the OpenStreetMap ecosystem + OsmAnd route engine hacking\nThis talk gives an overview of OpenStreetMap and will cover the following topics:- What is it and why is it awesome?- How is the data stored and how can it be edited- An overview of some useful tools, including how to query for specific featuresAfterwards, I'll explain how the OsmAnd route engine can be tweaked, in order to customize routeplanning just for you. (For example, one of my previous projects was adding ski routing into OsmAnd). (To tweak OsmAnd, you'll need an android device - bring yours. I have two spare ones though. It might work on jailbroken iPhones too)Note: feel free to come towards the end of the session if you only want to join the OsmAnd route engine hacking.",
