  "description": "Hypnosis lesson for beginner\n'''Important:''' In the previous years, we regularly had way too many people trying to get in (rooms are objects of finite size), with waiting lines all across the hallway. This year, we want to avoid the crowd control issues that come with such scenarios. That's why you now need to pre-register for the workshop at https://ticket.kinkygeeks.de. Our website will give you a free ticket, which you need to provide at the workshop door to gain access.Workshop Handout:Http://ideerly.de/hypno-kink-handout.pdf",
