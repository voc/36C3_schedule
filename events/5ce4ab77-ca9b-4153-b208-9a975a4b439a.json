  "description": "Write a simple kernel driver, debug and trace it remotely with gdb.\nIn this hands-on workshop, you have a chance to learn some cool tricks working with Linux kernel code. KGDB, the kernel debugger, allows you to debug a kernel running on a different architecture, remotely, just like you would debug a program running in userspace. A powerful trace infrastructure makes it easier to spot issues in time-sensitive systems, when setting a breakpoint is not an option. ",
