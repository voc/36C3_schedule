But if you don't know what it is, or how you can use it to do all sorts of cool things, then this fun and easy workshop is for you. As an example project, we'll be creating a '''TV-B-Gone''' remote control out of an '''Arduino''' you can take home with you.<br> <br> ''(This is one of many cool things happening throughout 36C3 in the huge '''Hardware Hacking Area!)'''''<br> <br> This workshop will be given twice<br>(both identical):<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Day 2: 28-Dec, 1pm - 4:30pm<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Day 3: 29-Dec, 1pm - 4:30pm<br>\n",
