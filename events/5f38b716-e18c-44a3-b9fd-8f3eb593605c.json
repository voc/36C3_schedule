If at all, people know that once upon a time, they were\r\nstoring phone books on SIM cards.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nEvery so often there are some IT security news about SIM card\r\nvulnerabilities, and SIM card based attacks on subscribers.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nLet's have a look at SIM card technology during the past almost 30\r\nyears and cover topics like\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Quick intro to ISO7816 smart cards</li>\r\n<li>SIM card hardware, operating system, applications</li>\r\n<li>SIM card related specification bodies, industry, processes</li>\r\n<li>from SIM to UICC, USIM, ISIM and more</li>\r\n<li>SIM toolkit, proactive SIM</li>\r\n<li>eSIM</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n</p>",
