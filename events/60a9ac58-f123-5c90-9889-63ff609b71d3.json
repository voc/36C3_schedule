In the last few years we have been busy creating a network of tech-coops in Germany and beyond. \r\n\r\nIn this session we want to share general information about tech-coops, why we think they are awesome and what we've learned so far. We also want to create a general space to have a discussion about tech-coops and learn from our experiences.",
