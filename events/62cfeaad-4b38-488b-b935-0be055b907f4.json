Instead of giving up, we decided to hack the hackerspace itself; find a system where internal conflict actually gets solved. We did an number of workshops to figure out how to do this, we wrote everything down, and got to work. Six years later, the disorganized workshop notes turned into an actual booklet: the hackerspace blueprint. We hope you can use this to solve issues in your organization.",
