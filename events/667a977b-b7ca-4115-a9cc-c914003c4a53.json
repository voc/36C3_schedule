  "abstract": "Monero has a unique among the major crypto currencies approach to scaling, that relies on a penalty driven adaptive blockweight (blocksize) and  a minimum or tail block reward. This is fundamentally different from the fixed blockweight and falling bock rewards that are prevalent in Bitcoin and Bitcoin clones. We will provide an overview of Monero\u2019s adaptive blockweight, fee market and how blockweight differs from blocksize together with the dual median changes and transaction changes that were introduced in the 2019 spring and fall network updates.  We will compare adaptive vs fixed blockweights, and the impact of minimum block rewards (Monero) vs falling block rewards (Bitcoin and Bitcoin clones) on long term network security.",
