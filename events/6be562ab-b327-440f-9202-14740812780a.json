  "description": "Build your own 3.3-12V power supply (moderate soldering experience helpful)\nThe Binary Kitchen soldering workshop goes 36C3. We are providing a soldering workshop for several and completely different soldering kits. Come and solder with us, an manual and 38 soldering irons.The ATX-Breakoutboard is a handy breakout board to get all important voltages from an standard ATX power supply: 3.3 V to 12 V. You just attach a ATX power supply and it works!... Hopefully :)Moderate soldering experiences are helpful but not needed. We don't have a sign up list, just come by and solder (but we just have 38 seats, first come first serve).[[File:atx-breakout-board.jpg|600px]]* More information about other Workshops: https://www.binary-kitchen.de/wiki/doku.php?id=veranstaltungen:nibble_area* More information about the ATX breakout board: https://github.com/Binary-Kitchen/SolderingTutorial/tree/master/ATXBreakoutBoardSMD",
