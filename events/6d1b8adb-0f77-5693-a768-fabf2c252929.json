  "abstract": "LoRaWAN is a **Lo**ng **Ra**nge **W**ide **A**rea **N**etwork that can connect devices over several kilometres while operating on very low power. It uses freely available frequencies, and with successful community project *The Things Network* there exists an open and free network. This makes LoRaWAN ideal for that small gadgets you want to deploy out in the field and also really interesting for a hacker community. Let's get working on it!",
  "description": "We will be going through the whole process of how to build, program, and setup a simple LoRaWAN connected device using an *Arduino* and *The Things Network*. The workshop will start with an introduction to how LoRaWAN works, but the session is planed to be a more interactive format where we get a bit of work done together.\r\n\r\nIf you need an introduction, why LoRaWAN is interesting, you can watch our 20min talk from last year: <br>\r\nhttps://media.ccc.de/v/35c3chaoswest-27-long-range-radio-communication-for-everyone-using-lorawan-\r\n\r\nIf you want to know how you can come prepared, go to: <br>\r\nhttps://www.deepcyber.de/36c3/lorawan",
