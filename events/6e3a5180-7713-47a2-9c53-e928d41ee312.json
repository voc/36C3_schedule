  "description": "A collection of art projects inspired by Julian Assange and Wikileaks\nArt deliberately creates a chaos, a distortion, an exception by returning to the source (of freedom of information, free flow, of free expression, of a free tech, a mathematic/scientific formula) from which we redistribute the codes/ signs/ symbols and their meanings consciously to the consumer, thus a chaos with acceptance as an emergent autonomous power to create the new norm.",
