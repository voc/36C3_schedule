  "description": "Build your own game console!\n[[File:MAKERbuino.jpg|800px]]This is a building session for kids (11+) and grown-ups at 36C3. I know that kids are usually not interested in as many talks as grown-ups, so there's a potentially high demand for fun stuff to do for kids at 36C3. For this reason, the MAKERbuino kits are intended to be built by 1. kids and 2. non-kids (everybody else). If you're a grown-up, you're most welcome to join the session! Build your own kit if there are any kits left and/or consider helping a kid if you already have some basic soldering experience.We'll have 10 seats available at Hamsterspace@HHA. Here are some additional hints:* If you're a kid, bring a parent if you can! * If you've never soldered before, build a small kit before building a MAKERbuino. There's plenty of opportunity at 36C3 to gain basic soldering experience during the days before the session, for example:** [[Learn_to_solder|Learn To Solder (Hardware Hacking Area)]]** [[Session:Soldering_Workshop_(Chaos_macht_Schule)|Soldering Workshop (Chaos macht Schule)]]*More information [[MAKERbuino|can be found here]].",
