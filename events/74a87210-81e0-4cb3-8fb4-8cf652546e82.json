  "description": "Let's have a brainstorm about how technology can help the grassroots and labor organizing. Can we make it possible for gig economy workers to organize? Can we make it easier for people who've never been activists to get started? What are the needs, and what are the risks? We've been talking to labor unions big and small, and we have a lot of experience about the logistics of social movements. So we'll start by outlining what we've learned. If there's time, we'll tell you about an app we're making that will have several functionalities we believe to be helpful - but most of all, we want this to be a collaborative discussion.\n",
