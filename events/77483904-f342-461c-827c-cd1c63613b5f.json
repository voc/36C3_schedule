Our aim is to both raise awareness for issues that are often overlooked and to facilitate exchange between those interested in fixing it.About the Project:\"Accessibility sounds great, but where do I start?\" \u2013Join us to discuss common issues around creating accessible spaces. We want to share our experiences creating inclusive environments, and we'd love to hear yours too!This session is intended to be a forum for people who are interested in accessibility and inclusion, folks who have specific access needs they would like organizers to consider more routinely, and of course organizers that are interested in fixing those issues.",
