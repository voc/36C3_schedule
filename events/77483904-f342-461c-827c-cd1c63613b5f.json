  "description": "<strong>Hacking everyday communication practices to change the world</strong><br><br>\n<strong>Workshop Description: </strong><br><br>\"Accessibility sounds great, but where do I start?\" \u2013Join us to discuss common issues around creating accessible spaces. We want to share our experiences creating inclusive environments, and we'd love to hear yours too! <br><br>The aim of this workshop is to both raise awareness for issues that are often overlooked and to facilitate exchange between those interested in fixing it. Hacker culture is meant for curious people to experience and experiment with new things: technologies, cultures, and sometimes their different selves. But openness doesn't automatically lead to accessibility and inclusion \u2013 we have to make it happen ourselves! This session is similar to the one we did at CCCamp earlier in 2019. <br><br>This session is intended to be a forum for people who are interested in accessibility and inclusion, folks who have specific access needs they would like organizers to consider more routinely, and of course organizers that are interested in changing the world in small steps \u2013 starting with ourselves and the needs of members in our communities. <br><br>If you can't join this session or would like to give feedback afterwards, you can find infos here: https://www.angela.is/36C3/<br><br><strong>About the SocialTech project: </strong><br><br>The goal of the SocialTech project is to show that small changes in everyday communication and interpersonal interactions improve inclusion dramatically. Our current project is to create a resource pool to help inspire people as they endeavour to make their projects more inclusive. Using concepts from academia, design, activism and community organization we developed a set of questions to start a conversation about accessibility that you can use and adapt to your unique situation.",
