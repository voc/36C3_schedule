  "description": "Playing cards, sewer pipes, plant pots, canisters, pans, peanut butter jars, vases, washers \u2026\r\n\r\nSchaltkreis Musik create quirky motorized instruments from items and strangely familiar found objects. These machines can be played like drum computers through rhythm-sequencers. Combined with microphones and effects a versatile beat instrument is formed, that can be played \u2013 even with no musical experience. \r\n\r\nInteracting with the machine sounds, Lorenz Blaumer uses his violin together with live-sampling to generate rhythmic patterns, ambient sounds and bass lines \u2013 sometimes even a melody.\r\n\r\nhttps://schaltkreismusik.bandcamp.com",
