This session provides a welcoming space to discuss what it means to be a communist today, to offer support and to build solidarity.The Commie Curious Prime Directive\"Commie Curious is a heterodox space for good faith discussions. All comrades are welcome, including all tendencies and backgrounds. We understand and truly believe that everyone is working towards the best possible conditions for all people, given what they know, their skills and abilities, the resources available, and the situation at hand. We are here to listen and learn from each other.\"",
