  "description": "Discussing Free Software tools for social research\nDuring my sociology master thesis I tried a lot of free software and developed a profound workflow from literature research, interview preparation and processing to analysis, note taking and the final writing process. Because I have made the experience that especially in the social sciences and humanities there is hardly any technical interest, there is also little information about free software among fellow students. Therefore I would like to use the about:freedom space to introduce the tools I have used and exchange information about alternative software for academic use. I'm just finishing my sociology master's degree at Osnabr\u00fcck University and would like to become a journalist afterwards. Free Software has always been important to me since I've been using Linux for about ten years now and I'm always looking for new, useful software and try to share my knowledge for example at CryptoParties.",
