  "description": "Welcome to Pi Mapper - a free and open source tool for projection mapping on the Raspberry Pi\nPi Mapper is an open source projection mapping tool intended to be used on the Raspberry Pi minicomputers to reduce cost and licensing complications. It started as an addon for the openFrameworks creative coding toolkit and now is available as a disk image that one can download from https://ofxpimapper.com. During the workshop we will go through the process of installing the disk image and best practices on how to use it for your best projection mapping project. If you are strong and motivated, please bring your own Raspberry Pi (please no Raspberry Pi 4 yet), a monitor or a projector.",
