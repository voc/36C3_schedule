  "description": "Measure local pollution levels by building your own particle matter sensor system. This DIY setup allowed everyone to measure air quality. Join thousands around the world by contributing the data to citizen science projects with open data. The system uses off the shelf parts with no soldering (design by OK Lab Stuttgart as part of the https://luftdaten.info/\u00a0 project).\n",
