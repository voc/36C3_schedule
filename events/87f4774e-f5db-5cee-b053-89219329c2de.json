  "description": "# Non-isolated DC/DC converters\r\n\r\nDC-to-DC converters are cheap and ubiquitous, but many still feel uncomfortable using them. In this talk I will talk about step-down (buck) and step-up (boost) converters, covering the basics in an easy-to-understand form, and touching on the knowledge you need to build your own.\r\n\r\nThis talk will be enjoyable for you if you have basic electronics knowledge: you understand what voltage, resistance, and current mean.\r\n\r\n##Outline\r\n- Theory of operation explained with illustrations\r\n- Synchronous and asynchronous converters: advantages and disadvantages\r\n- How to chose and evaluate cheap DC/DC converter modules you can buy online\r\n- Efficiency and sources of energy loss\r\n- Features you might want: Enable, Current Limiting, Undervoltage Protection\r\n- Control modes: voltage mode, current mode, and hysteretic mode\r\n- Unstable converters, and how to fix them\r\n- Switching noise, and how to deal with it\r\n- What if you need more voltage? Boost converters!",
