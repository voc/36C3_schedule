  "description": "<a href=\"https://openbsd.org\">OpenBSD's website</a> advertises a secure and modern operating system, with cool and modern mitigations. But no rational analysis is provided: are those mitigations effective? what are their impacts on performances, inspectability and complexity? against what are they supposed to defend? how easy are they to bypass? where they invented by OpenBSD or by others? is OpenBSD's reputation warranted?\r\n\r\nThis talk aims at answering all those questions, for all OpenBSD's mitigations, because, in the words of <a href=\"https://twitter.com/ryiron/status/1150924668020203521\">Ryan Mallon</a>:\r\n\r\n<quote>Threat modelling rule of thumb: if you don\u2019t explain exactly what you are securing against and how you secure against it, the answers can be assumed to be: \u201cbears\u201d and \u201cnot very well\u201d.</quote>\r\n\r\nAll the research done for this talk is available on <a href=\"https://isopenbsdsecu.re\">isopenbsdsecu.re</a>",
