  "subtitle": "",
  "track": "Resilience & Sustainability",
  "type": "Talk 20 minutes + 5 minutes Q&A",
  "language": "en",
  "abstract": "Compared to software, the open source approach is relatively new to most actors in the field of (mechanical) hardware. Plus Open Source Hardware faces some special issues. A yet missing definition of its \"source code\" is one of them (+ patent law, liability, engineers that do not know how to work with git, costly prototyping\u2026).\r\nDIN SPEC 3105 will be/is the first official standard for Open Source Hardware and also the first official standard ever published under a free license (CC-BY-SA 4.0; that was a lot of lobby work ;) ). It defines the technology-specific \"source\" of Open Source Hardware and aims to build a bridge between research institutes, public authority, industry and the worldwide open source community.",
  "description": "In this talk I won't explain why Open Source (Hardware) is great. I assume, you all know that (if not, still feel free to ask me in the Q&A part or after the talk). I'll describe what's the standard for, how it works and why its great _for_ Open Source Hardware.",
