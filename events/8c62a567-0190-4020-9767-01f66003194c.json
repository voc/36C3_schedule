  "description": "We collect open data to inform better about asylum and migration\nSince 2016, the Refugee Datathon Munich meet to find and collect open data to inform about the refugee situation world wide. The original target audience are refugee supporters. They often aren't technical, but need information on acceptance quotas and similar data. The public is another audience. And then there is us: While discussing, researching and working with this data, we learn a lot about migration on this planet, the legal situation in Germany, and Open Data.Let us work on some issues. It can be getting data from the OECD API, or eurostat, or from PDFs in documents. Or bringing this data in a more presentable form (visualizations), or explaining it in an online article.",
