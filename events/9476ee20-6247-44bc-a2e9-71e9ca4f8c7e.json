  "description": "We will watch the first 3 episodes of the most recent anime adaption of the first part of THE BEST MANGA IN THE WORLD: JoJo's Bizarre Adventure (JJBA) by Hirohiko Araki and talk a bit.\nWhile the JJBA comics are ongoing for more than 30 years now currently in part 9, the part 1 animation itself consists of 9 episodes that in itself tell a tightly packed thriller story of 19th century English gentlemen and the invasion of a devil in disguise.   Eccentric poses, fresh and innovative ideas, fast-paced story telling and overall unparalleled aesthetics in manga and anime adaptation made it an all-time masterpiece as well as a source for memes and references in modern media, even inspiring Billie Eilish's outfits.   Episodes are in Japanese with English subtitles. We'll have some time to look at a few memes, the troubled history of JJBA in the west and current development as well :)",
