  "description": "In this session we will explore the notions used in hacking through interactive physical exercises. Creating the body-based code for the software, based on systemic thinking and non-equilibrium dynamics.\nLet\u2019s suppose that our bodymind is the hardware and our behavior is the software. A lot of the stuff we \"run\" are based on ancient concepts and outdated evolutionary circuits. Moreover, when we learn the new stuff we usually do it only intellectually, not letting the new information enter our bodies and become part of our everyday reflexes. In this workshop we want to share with you the open-source operating system for the bodymind \u221eOS.Taking as inspiration the latest findings from complex systems theory and network science we come up with powerful physical metaphors that can be observed in nature and then activate them on the level of the body. We combine them with various approaches found in martial art Systema and contemporary dance to create engaging, interactive and informative exercises, which we then practice together to upgrade our software for the 21st century.",
