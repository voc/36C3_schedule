  "description": "Originally used in computer games and for special effects in blockbuster movies, \u2018simulated life\u2019, driven by algorithmic predictions, is increasingly influencing many facets of the real world. From urban planning to disaster evacuation plans, market forecasts and crowd control, algorithmically simulated scenarios produce real world policies and events. Using a variety of images including filmed footage as well as simulations of crowd control software, Transformation Scenario is a meditation on \u2018simulated life\u2019 and the increasingly blurred distinctions between real and virtual experiences. This video is part of a larger body of work by von Wedemeyer that engages with the psychology and aesthetics of the crowd.",
