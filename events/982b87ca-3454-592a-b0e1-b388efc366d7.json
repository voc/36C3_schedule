  "abstract": "An in-depth look at cryptographically secure append-only logs, the data structures powering blockchain-less peer-to-peer protocols such as [Secure Scuttlebutt](https://scuttlebutt.nz/), [Hypercore (Dat)](https://dat.foundation/), or [Holochain](https://holochain.org/).",
  "description": "Without requiring prior knowledge of the peer-to-peer world, we examine the fundamentals of the single-writer append-only log that forms the heart of a variety of new-ish protocols for decentralized communication. Planned topics:\r\n\r\n- how does the data structure work?\r\n- why do we care?\r\n- dealing with forks\r\n- efficient partial verification/replication",
