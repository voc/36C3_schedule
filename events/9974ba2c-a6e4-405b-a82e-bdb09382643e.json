  "description": "Free software and freedom philosophy gives a ray of hope to Anatolian minorities. With free documentation and free software, with using their devices in their own language, people may keep their language alive by contributing projects like Wiktionary and Wikisource.\nIn Turkey, along the Anatolia, more than 25 languages are spoken. As \u00d6zg\u00fcr Yaz\u0131l\u0131m Derne\u011fi (Free Software Association of Turkey), we wanted to translate our website and works to these Anatolian languages such as Kurdish, Zazaki, Lazuri, Homshetsi and so on. After we started conversations with culture institutes and associations from these folks, they replied as they are not able to use their devices with their own language. So now, we started a project with Anatolian minorities, we are translating and documenting GNU/Linux, GNOME, Firefox and LibreOffice (maybe Android/Replicant) to this languages, so with free software, these people can use computers and mobile phones with their own language. Also we are starting Wiktionary and Wikipedia ersions in these languages in order to keep these languages alive and compile the documents and publications in their language to make them documented well.     In this talk at 36C3,  we will tell a project in Turkey (a developing country which has no free software consciousness). In our project, Anatolian languages and minorities' cultures may be kept in the future. So many people uses proprietary software in their devices. These minorities are repressed to use their languages, not only their publication houses were closed by government, but also they were judged at \"National Security Courts\" in Turkey. With these assimilation policies, especially Lazuri and Homshetsi languages are imperilment right now, children are acquiring only Turkish as main tongue. Proprietary software and \"proprietarians\" are only seeking for profit, surveillance, and oppressing people's freedoms, so they are not able to use their devices with their own language. This situation makes the position of their languages much worse.    Free software and freedom philosophy gives a ray of hope to Anatolian minorities. With free documentation and free software, with using their devices in their own language, people may keep their language alive by contributing projects like Wiktionary and Wikisource.",
