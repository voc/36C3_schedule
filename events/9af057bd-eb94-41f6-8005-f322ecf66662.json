  "description": "Currently Facebook has a tight grip on the cultural scene with its events-calendar and with Instagram as a spectacular image feed. <br>\r\nBut an opposition is rising. Graffiti and net-art are merging with hacking. Activists are using facebook graffiti, through circulating UTF-8 textbombs that cross the layout of the feed.<br>\r\nThe Berlin network Reclaim Club Culture meanwhile is calling for a Facebook Exodus. They want to motivate the club and cultural scene to support free alternatives, by moving their biggest information capital, which are the event announcements. ",
