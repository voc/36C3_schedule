  "description": "Introduction into Arduino, Sensors and Servomotors. Hands on how to get things moving depending on the sensor output.\nGetting things move in interaction with the surrounding gives your robots or other creatures more 'personality'. Here is an example of an eye starting to blink if you approach and getting faster and faster if you are getting too close.  https://twitter.com/wellenleiter/status/994312455005368322The Make article describes a Robot always circulation in the direction somebody approaches and also blinking with the eyes...which is supposed to work as a propaganda bot at events. http://www.wellenleiter.net/bewegende-momente/ (it is freely availabel at the heise website)The Workshop will give a short introduction on programming with Arduino, the technology of different distance sensors and servos and how to get them controlled with an Arduino. Please bring your Arduino and Servo an US- or IR-Sensor (e.g. HC - SR04) if possible. I will bring a bunch of Ultrasonic Ranging Module HC - SR04 and some sparse Arduino. You should have a running Arduino Software (https://www.arduino.cc/en/Main/Software) and  Servo-Library  (https://www.arduino.cc/en/Guide/Libraries). * For FNIs only. *",
