Transfinite games, of course!In this fast-paced talk with many hands-on parts, you will learn about:* Nim, a fun game played with a finite number of coins. Learn how to optimally play this game!* Numbers larger than infinity. (This will be a five-minute excerpt of the [https://events.ccc.de/congress/2018/wiki/index.php/Session:Wondrous_Mathematics:_Fun_with_infinitely_large_numbers longer talk] on infinite numbers.) After the talk, you can impress your friends by effortlessly computing with numbers larger than infinity!* Transfinite Nim, a fun variant of Nim which is played with infinitely many coins. And learn how to optimally play this game!* The epic battle of Herkula against the hydra. The hydra grows more and more heads, but with your knowledge of infinity you'll be able to fight it!* Transfinite variants of puzzles like: \"I don't know which number you mean. \u2013 Neither do I know which number ''you'' mean. \u2013 Now I know your number. \u2013 And now I know yours as well.\"Bring your kids (age 12 or older)!",
