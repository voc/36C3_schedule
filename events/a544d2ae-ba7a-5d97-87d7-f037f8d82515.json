  "description": "BLODEUWEDD (Blod-day-weth) Experience the story of a mystical woman made of flowers, told for you alone with handmade miniature puppets. Part of an ancient legend from Wales, Blodeuwedd is a tale of identity, hardship and free will.\r\n\r\nWith: Owain Griffiths, Hannah Morris\r\n\r\nLambe Lambe \u2013 this is theatre for individualists. For those who are reluctant to share theatre experience with a large audience. A show, just for one person at a time. A moment just for you! Lambe Lambe is a theatre technique that has been revived and celebrated since the 1990s, especially in Latin America. It is widespread all over the world and has recently been on the rise again. In miniature theatre boxes, figures and objects are played in short scenes for only one spectator at a time. Meet a strong woman out of an old myth from Wales, face memories and nightmares and let yourself be disco-healed. Compagnie What's in my box is based in Leipzig and invites you to choose your box and enter worlds that are made just for you.",
