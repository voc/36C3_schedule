  "description": "Verifpal is new software for verifying the security of cryptographic protocols. Building upon contemporary research in symbolic formal verification, Verifpal\u2019s main aim is to appeal more to real-world practitioners, students and engineers without sacrificing comprehensive formal verification features.\r\n\r\nIn order to achieve this, Verifpal introduces a new, intuitive language for modeling protocols that is much easier to write and understand than the languages employed by existing tools.",
