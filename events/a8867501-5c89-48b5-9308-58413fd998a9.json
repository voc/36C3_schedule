  "description": "We've all seen the TV show Silicon Valley, but have you actually peered underneath the curtain to see what's happening? In this entertaining talk, Sasha will share his first hand experience at building (and failing) a robotics delivery startup in Berkeley.\r\n\r\nOver the course of 2.5 years this startup built hundreds of robots, delivered thousands of orders, and had one robot stolen. The talk will look over the insanity that's involved with building an ambitious startup around a crazy vision; sharing the ups and downs of the journey. It will also touch up lightly on the technology that drives it and the simplistic approach to AI/machine learning this company took.",
