  "description": "A short introduction into the international language Esperanto. A planned language actually spoken by nerds all over the world\nMany nerds all over the world use the language Esperanto as their language for world wide communication. There are lots of meetups where the language is used. From congresses with several thousand participants to smaller more specialized meetups like the conference for the use of Esperanto in science and technology. Besides the meetups there are lots of projects on the net, like podcasts, rock music, chat groups, etc.For the curious we give a short insight into the language itself as into its culture and history.For questions contact: 36c3@johannes-mueller.org",
