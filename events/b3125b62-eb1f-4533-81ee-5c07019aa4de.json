  "description": "My idea was to give a talk about the open source protocol we have created. Its main idea is to change the way we search for things by using sybil resistant mechanism for indexation and ranking, knowledge graphs and computational resources that are required for this. \r\n\r\nThe protocol is built with the help of ipfs and tendernint. The cool thing is that with changing Semantics we create along much more use cases that web 3 browsers (which are in fact personal applications), we can create unified linguistics, autonomous robots, solve some basic income issues, program complex matrices, create language convergence, proof of location, etc\r\n\r\nOur main goal is to fuckgoogle, which is basically our motto. So the idea was to talk about the issues we underestimate that derive from centralized search, ranking, indexation, etc. Why search is important and why web 2 is broken",
