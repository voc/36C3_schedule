  "description": "Getting together and writing letters and postcards to hackers in prison\nHacktivism from time to time leads to imprisonment and repressions. There are several people right now siting in jail that consider themselves anarchist or did actions that are supported by anarchist community. Not to let those people alone in prison we would like to have every day 1 hour around the table, where we get to know the stories of imprisoned activists and write them some words of support with postcards/letters. You don't need any special skills for that. The postcards will be there for you.",
