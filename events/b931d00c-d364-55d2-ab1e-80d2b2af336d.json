  "description": "Is this your first visit to Congress and you're unsure if you will fit in, visiting alone, or are you a part of a minority at the event? ChaosPatinnen may be for you! Unfortunately, SignUps have already ended and all mentees have been matched into groups, so if you have not yet signed up, find yourself a helpful Hacker!\r\n\r\nThis is the opening event for mentees to meet their mentors, get to know more about the Assembly, and who to turn to for help! From here, we're off to the 11:00AM Keynote!\r\n\r\n-ChaosPatinnen Orga",
