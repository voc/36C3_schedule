  "description": "An open discussion of microarchitectural attacks: Spectre, Meltdown, side channels, and so on. What can we do and what should we do about them?\nLet's meet and talk side channels (and not only)!Topics of the discussion:* Should I care?** Do we really need to defend *all* systems against microarchitectural attacks and pay the full (and often high) price of the protection?** If not, in which cases is the protection necessary and when is it superfluous?* Practical defenses** There are numerous proposed defense mechanisms: static analysis, HW extensions, alternative CPU architectures, OS-level isolation, and many many others.** Yet, very few of them are used in practice. Why? What can we do to change it? * Short-term vs mid-term vs long-term** Which of the mechanisms are temporary solutions and which could solve the problem in the long run?** Memory safety and speculative executionIf you want to come, please, ping me @oleksii_o to help with planning.",
