  "description": "The RMX Hardware Wallet project started as an hw device case-study for privacy extremists. Main focus was given on the ability to serve like secure hardware messenger, cryptocurrency hardware wallet, file encryption token and authenticator. During the hw development, special care was given to support Monero. We want to share the actual state of our effort and talk about possible directions and strategies for the next year.",
