In the context of the workshop, participants will pragmatically explore different workflows, such as key generation, BIP39, entropy sources, shamir secret sharing. Workshop outcomes are shared in the code-repository of the workshop. ",

The institute is active in Austria, Cyprus and the US and exists since 2012. The institute is one of the world\u2019s earliest blockchain institutes. The cryptography and hardware division of RIAT exists since 2017 and works on communicating (open) hardware related topics to developers, enthusiasts and the general public.",
