  "description": "The open laser tag system is built on a ESP32 and a Android app. Laser Tag works with infrared, so the ESP32 is connected to a Infrared LED and a receiver. The infrared light is focused by a lens. The Android app is connected to the ESP32 via the onboard Bluetooth of the ESP32. The system is nearly playable. Currently we are working on a better case of the tagger. When you want to develop with us or want to have fun in the future with our system you are very welcome to contact us!",
