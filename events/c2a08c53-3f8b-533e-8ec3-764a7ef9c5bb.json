  "description": "Heat waves, wildfires and new movements like Fridays for Future and Extinction Rebellion have brought the climate crisis back into the news. If the world continues to emit greenhouse gases like today, the world will heat up by at least 3 degree celsius, potentially much more. Yet despite increased attention for the climate crisis no political action even remotely sufficient to tackle the problem is in sight.\r\n\r\nThe talk will give a brief overview of the state of the science of climate change, the politics and the scale of the challenge. It'll also give an overview of some - more or less scientific - worst case predictions that sometimes lead to claims that it's just \"too late to do something\", which may become a new form of justification for not doing anything.",
