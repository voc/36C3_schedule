  "description": "In his lecture Gauthier Roussilhe  summarises what we know today about the environmental impacts of digital industry. He addresses the sustainability of the current trajectory and how to think differently about digital industry.\r\n\r\nContesting the myths of dematerialisation and of the global village, he gives examples of digital web design based on CO2/energy budget rather than monetary budget. He also gives examples of digital tools that accept the materiality of their territory (geographical, infrastructures) to think of new digital uses.",
