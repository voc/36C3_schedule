  "description": "A story on how I build a mushroom lab from zero to the first flush.\nFor some years now i've been very fascinated of mushrooms - their diversity, features and importance. And with the release of\u00a0Star Trek Discovery my interest has shifted from \u201dWorld Wide Web\u201d to \u201cWood Wide Web\u201d, so I started to build a small laboratory to further explore these amazing creatures.This talk will be a story on how I build that lab from zero to the first flush. What I needed,\u00a0which tools i used, build and\u00a0bought. What I learned, how i failed and why I do that at all. How everything ended and how I met other people who inspired me to open up the idea and form a vision for a open DIYBio Laboratory in Hamburg.",
