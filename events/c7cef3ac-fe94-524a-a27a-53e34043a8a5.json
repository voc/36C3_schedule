  "description": "My students Jakov (14), Paul (15) and Jonathan (16) won the first price at  Jugend forscht 2019 (Bayern), by solving the n-queens problem with a quantum annealer. As the teacher of the three boys I will explain what it took to teach the boys how to use a D-Wave quantum annealer, how much knowledge of quantum physics was necessary and what the pupils had to know about formulating a mathematical puzzle as a quadratic unconstrained binary optimization (QUBO) problem.",
