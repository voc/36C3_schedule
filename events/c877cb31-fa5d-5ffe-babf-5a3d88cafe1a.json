  "description": "In Delay/Disruption-Tolerant Networking (DTN), data is transmitted in a store-carry-forward fashion from network node to network node. Between the transmissions, there may be no interconnected network for some time. Such networks are suitable whenever there is hardly any infrastructure available, e.g., in rural areas, disaster scenarios or in space.\r\n\r\nThis presentation will briefly explain the DTN technology and present the [dtn7-go](https://github.com/dtn7/dtn7-go) implementation.",
