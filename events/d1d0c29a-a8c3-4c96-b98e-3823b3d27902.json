  "description": "The 36C3 seems an excellent opportunity to take a look back at the instance of hacking which, even more so than previous events like the BTX Hack, brought the CCC into the focus of the (West-)German public \u2013 and, additionally, the Federal Office for the Protection of the Constitution (Verfassungsschutz) and the Federal Intelligence Service (Bundesnachrichtendienst).\r\n\r\nThis talk aims to focus on the uncovering of the KGB Hack, which began in 1986 when Clifford Stoll, a systems administrator at the University of California in Berkeley, noticed an intruder in his laboratory\u2019s computer system. It took three more years of relentless investigation on Stoll\u2019s part and laborious convincing of the authorities of the United States and the Federal Republic of Germany to trace back the intruder to a young man loosely connected to the CCC who worked with the KGB, selling information from US military networks to the Soviet Union. \r\n\r\nIn early March of 1989, the widely watched television news program ARD Im Brennpunkt informed the public of the \u201cbiggest instance of espionage since the Guillaume affair\u201d. It presented a new quality of high tech espionage, undertaken by \u201ccomputer freaks\u201d, somewhat shady young men connected to the Chaos Computer Club.\r\n\r\nThe reporting on the KGB Hack had a tremendously negative effect on the public image of hackers in general and the CCC in particular. Now the \u201ccomputer freaks\u201d were not benevolent geeks who pointed out flaws in computer systems anymore - they were criminals, working with the Russians, harming their own country. This negative image has been lingering until today.",
