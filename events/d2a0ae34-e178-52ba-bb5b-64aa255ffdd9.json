  "description": "During my sociology master thesis I tried a lot of free software and developed a profound workflow from literature research, interview preparation and processing to analysis, note taking and the final writing process. Because I have made the experience that especially in the social sciences and humanities there is hardly any technical interest, there is also little information about free software among fellow students. I would like to introduce the tools I have used and exchange information about alternative software for academic use.",
