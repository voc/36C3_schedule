  "description": "Computers can easily process gigabytes of data per second, and yet package installation in current Linux distributions achieves data rates of only a few megabytes per second, even on top-of-the-line computers.\r\n\r\nIn this talk, I explain current design choices and how one can make different design choices for drastically better outcomes. This is not just armchair criticism: I have implemented these ideas in a research Linux distribution to prove they\u2019re feasible.",
