  "abstract": "The Namecoin and Tor developers are running a new experiment: the GNU/Linux Nightly Builds of Tor Browser now have optional support for resolving Namecoin's .bit domains.  This experiment aims to provide a fix for the long-standing UX problem with .onion domains: the lack of human-meaningful names.  With Namecoin, you can access onion services via nice, memorable addresses like http://federalistpapers.bit/ instead of http://7fa6xlti5joarlmkuhjaifa47ukgcwz6tfndgax45ocyn4rixm632jid.onion/ .  In this talk, I'll cover the goals of the experiment, the work that went into getting here, and the work that remains to be done.",
  "description": "Disclaimer: Although the work covered in this talk is a collaboration between Namecoin and Tor, this talk is solely from Namecoin's perspective.",
