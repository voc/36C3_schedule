  "description": "This is a talk about the foundational crisis in mathematics and its resolution, G\u00f6del incompleteness phenomena (\"there are true statements which are provably unprovable\"), unknowability concerning infinity (the continuum hypothesis) and a new philosophy which gives an intriguing and coherent common perspective on these topics.\nThe talk gives a primer to the set-theoretic multiverse philosophy put forward by Joel David Hamkins.To enjoy the the talk, you should have an interest in the intersection of mathematics and philosophy, but you don't need to bring any specific mathematical or logical prerequisites. This talk is an invitation to follow along and ask lots of questions on the way. :-)'''[https://iblech.gitlab.io/bb/multiverse.html Paper the talk is based on]'''",
