  "description": "qaul.net is an Internet independent wifi mesh communication app with fully decentralized messaging, file sharing and voice chat. At the moment we are rewriting the entire application in rust, implementing our experience of 8 years off the grid peer2peer mesh communication, with a mobile first approach and a network agnostic routing protocoll wich can do synchronous as well as delay tolerant messaging.\r\n\r\nIn this workshop we will test the (pre-)alpha version together, install it, test the functionality and communicate off the grid. We will explore our new routing protocol and the wireless interconnection possibilities.\r\n\r\n* Homepage: https://qaul.net\r\n* Code Repository: https://git.open-communication.net/qaul/qaul.net",
