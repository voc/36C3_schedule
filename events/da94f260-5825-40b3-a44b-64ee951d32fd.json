  "description": "Hackbases are several different types of hackerspaces where people can also live at. The 6th yearly self-org session will be a common presentation of the existing and planned bases, tools to organize new ones, etc. Come if you're interested in different ways of living and doing work.\n'''''Hackbases are hackerspaces/hacklabs, that people also live in.'''''If you have regular paid work, there is a worrying probability it advances the political flux surrounding you - neoliberal capitalism. The current variety of places to work in - at universities, at NGOs, at \"ethical startups\", or even big corporations, as well as playful free-time participation within the current hackerspaces, could be insufficient to bring radical change, so needed by the many.Hackbases are experiments in alternative lifestyles, that for example could help you to focus on working to hack the planet.Find existing info:    * https://wiki.hackerspaces.org/Hackbase    * join #hackbases on Freenode !
