  "description": "Hackbases are similar to hackerspaces, but people also live there. The 6th yearly self-org session will present the existing ones, common lessons, and the tools to organize new ones. You should come if you're interested in different ways of living to: have a job + pay rent.\n'''''Hackbases are hackerspaces/hacklabs, that people also live in.'''''If you have regular work, it probably advances the political flux surrounding you - neoliberal capitalism. The current varieties of places to work in - at universities, at NGOs, at \"ethical startups\", or even big corporations, as well as playful free-time participation within the current hackerspaces, feels insufficient to bring radical change, so needed by the many.Hackbases are experiments in alternative lifestyles that could be the missing link towards supporting socio-natural transformations.Amazing!
