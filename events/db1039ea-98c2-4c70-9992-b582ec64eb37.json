  "description": "DIY Diafilm\nWhat is diafilm (rus. \u0414\u0438\u0430\u0444\u0438\u043b\u044c\u043c)Diafilm is a story or tale painted on the film and projected on wall (or any surface). You project the pictures via device with lenses and light. There were many models of dia-projectors in Soviet Union. You can find them on flea markets for instance, or in the grandma's home.People who were born in USSR remember soviet diafilms, the pictures there were printed and the plots usually were based on folk tales.DYI diafilm is has the same format, but it hand-painted or scratched, so anyone can create it. And the story can be really surrealistic, crazier is better.",
