  "description": "One of the assumptions of my doctoral research on the art of hacking is the idea that the historical avant-garde of the 20th century may be interpreted as a main intellectual precondition of hacktivism. I demonstrate that the existing theoretical framework available to analyze the traditions of avant-garde art can provide valuable new aspects to understand hacktivism, as well as to highlight the analogies between the historical avant-garde\u2019s revolutionary ethics and those of hacktivism.",
