If you're an experienced rum lover, you're welcome to join and help me out with things I didn't know yet. But really the event is primarily about enjoying different types of rum together and getting an idea of what consitutes a good rum and which types you like best. Please read the information on to the foodhackingbase wiki page: https://foodhackingbase.org/wiki/Rum_tasting_36c3 and register a slot in the dudle.If you have rum that you would like to bring for others to taste, we'd be very happy and you're very welcome!",
