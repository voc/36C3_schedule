  "description": "EU Software Patents v3.0\nThe Unitary Patent is the third attempt to impose software patents in Europe. Software patents are a threat to small- and medium-sized software companies that cannot defend themselves. The UPC (Unified Patent Court) is an international court made outside of the European Union (EU), which would have the last word over the question of software patenting. The Court would favour \u201cpatent trolls\u201d which steal our jobs and extort money.",
