  "description": "Let\u2019s come together, connect and talk about DIYBio\nThe\u00a0DIYBio community\u00a0is a network of\u00a0Do-It-Yourself and Do-It-Together biologists. They come together at meetups and spaces to support other people and to learn and work with plants, microbiology and bio-technology.\u00a0But in contrast to open workshops like Fablabs, Hacker- and Makerspaces, which are rapidly growing, such bio-laboratories are still rare to find and/or not easily accessible. I personally want to establish such a space in my city, and I am interested to hear what you think about DIYBio and what you might have already learned or achieved.So let us come together,\u00a0connect\u00a0and talk about DIYBio:\u00a0the intentions, responsibilities,\u00a0chances, risks and problems. What is required to build such a space, how to grow partnerships? Let's share ideas for workshops, projects and collaborations! I would love to hear your input so we can come up with a good plan that goes into the right direction!",
