  "description": "Many schools in Germany choose to distribute their substitute plans via the proprietary [[DSB platform]](https://heinekingmedia.de/education/digitales-schwarzes-brett). The provided client software is not very pleasurable to use and inconveniences users with its dependency on Google Play Services. That's why I develop a free client for Android called DSBDirect, which is able to display plans in a nice, filtered way. Since they noticed my app, the company operating DSB has been obfuscating their various endpoints more and more in an attempt to prevent my app from working, while on the other hand not being very competent at security. It's a cat-and-mouse game.",
