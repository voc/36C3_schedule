  "abstract": "In this talk, we will discuss forks as human consensus failure modes, why they happen and their consequences. We will look at examples of forks in different social structures: from hunter-gatherer tribes and religious factions, to open source projects and, particularly, the cryptoeconomic protocols that enable decentralized infrastructure. We will cover the dynamics at play in forks from multiples angles: technical, economical, political, and theological.",
