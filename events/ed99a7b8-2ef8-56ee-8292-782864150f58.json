  "abstract": "This talk will teach you what Google\u2019s official claim of supremacy means and how quantum computing will practically change the world of cryptocurrency. You will understand why Google and any other quantum computer could be about to beak blockchain-based cryptocurrency, see what new ways are in place to save blockchain from quantum, and learn why crypto is a potential application for \u2018quantum supremacy\u2019.",
  "description": "Google announced that it has built and tested a 54-qubit quantum processor. \u2018Quantum supremacy\u2019 means that Google has been able to perform a calculation that is impossible to perform on traditional supercomputers. But what does \u2018quantum supremacy\u2019 mean for cryptocurrency and crypto mining, where having a highly efficient machine gives you an edge over everyone else?\r\nIn this talk, I will explain quantum computing, \u2018quantum supremacy\u2019, and cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum in an understandable and entertaining way. I will also introduce the biggest danger to blockchain from \u2018quantum supremacy\u2019. With this milestone, a long-anticipated step toward useful quantum computers, understanding what new ways are in place to save crypto from \u2018quantum supremacy\u2019 and how crypto should prepare for \u2018quantum supremacy\u2019 is key to evaluate the facts.\r\nA surprising potential application for Google\u2019s \u2018quantum supremacy\u2019 is cryptocurrency. Applying \u2018quantum supremacy\u2019 to generate certifiable random numbers for blockchain helps to understand the advantages and disadvantages of quantum computing. As a cryptocurrency expert, I will give you insights into these as well as further real-world applications.",
