  "description": "Android Open Source Project (AOSP)'s build system differs greatly from other GNU/Linux based distribution: software components are built and bundled together into a single image without using any package manager during the build process; external software components are also tasked with maintaining support for AOSP build system themselves. Theses differences creates some extremely serious issues that also affect Replicant, a fully free software Android distribution. To solve that, we aim to foster a discussion with other projects and the community on sustainable ways to achieve an AOSP build that properly incorporates GNU/Linux projects such as Linux and Mesa. This talk might also be interesting to people packaging Android utilities like adb in GNU/Linux distributions, as they also have to deal with some of the issues created by the Android build system.\n",
