(Day 2, 19h00) please sign in here].[https://dudle.inf.tu-dresden.de/cheeserendezvous2_36c3/ To secure spot on the Session II. (Day 3, 19h00) please sign in here].If you love cheese this event is must, long story short. This is our cheese tasting paradise, cultivated through event to event and yes we should have again \"cheese tasting train\" taking around our samples, fingers crossed (or rather dipped in lazily running aged camembert :-))!Each session is open to 25 people max, please do sign in advance, you can just show up before the event but we are very likely going to be full for t his one. If you can bring cheese which you made by yourself that would be great! Of course some specific local or extraordinary cheese/s or other related condiments like sun dried tomatoes, good quality olives, mustards, wine all would be appreciated. If you are bringing cheese please do label it well with at least it's name and type of milk used, your nick or name/contact would come handy too. The best would be of course to add short description to our wiki (please check the sample). FHB will be getting the main high quality cheeses to offer basic selection with other samples surrounding it plus some basic condiments. Note that due to the interest in previous years we are going to run two sessions each one close to two hours long.This event is based on '''donation at your will no one turned away for lack of funds'''. So lets meet all together again enjoying these lovely creations! Here you can find cheeses which are going to be present, please do add your ones and keep in mind that good half of the cheeses will be not listed here, they will just appear and they are worth of your attention!'''List of possible candidates'''{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"!
