  "description": "Inder Taneja attempted to write the integers from 1 up to 11111 in terms of 1 to 9 by using addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, exponentiation, parenthesis and/or digit concatenation. For example:\r\n\r\n    9617 = 1+2^3*(45+(6+7)*89) \r\n    9618 = 1*(2+3+4+5)*(678+9)\r\n    9619 = 1+(2+3+4+5)*(678+9)\r\n\t\r\nThese are generally referred to as crazy sequential representations (CSR). Interestingly, within the 1 up to 11111 range, only one CSR remains to be identified, namely the CSR for 10958.",
