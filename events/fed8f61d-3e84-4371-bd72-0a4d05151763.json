The idea is to deal with serious topics like the climate crisis in a playful way and share knowledge and ideas for change in the process. Maybe this contains some ideas that might inspire you. How the session will work: We will play and reflect on several improv exercises and games that link to sustainability. - Improv theater is basically theater without a script, with characters and stories created in teamwork between the actors.- You do not need to know anything about improv to attend, and we will try to make everyone feel safe and welcome.- Everyone can do this, you do not need to be particularly brave, spontaneous or creative :-)",
