The idea is to deal with serious topics like the climate crisis in a playful way and share knowledge and ideas for change in the process. Maybe this contains some ideas that might inspire you. How the session will work: We will play and reflect on several improv exercises and games that link to sustainability. - Improv theater is basically theater without a script, with characters and stories created in teamwork between the actors.- You do not need to know anything about improv to attend, and we will try to make everyone feel safe and welcome.- Everyone can do this, you do not need to be particularly brave, spontaneous or creative :-)Here is a summary of what we did: \t\t\u25cb Intro, reasoning behind workshop design\t\t\u25cb Shake hands and discuss (pairs)\t\t\t\u00a7 Why did I come here?\t\t\t\u00a7 What does the term 'sustainability' mean to me?\t\t\u25cb Rant about something regarding sustainability (in pairs)\t\t\t\u00a7 Person A rants on an issue on micro or macro level\t\t\t\u00a7 Person B listens, silently\t\t\t\u00a7 Person B then describes patterns she heard in what A said and names potential solutions\t\t\t\u00a7 Switch roles and repeat\t\t\u25cb \"Superheroes I have a problem\" (in groups of 4)\t\t\t\u00a7 A) Multiple solutions, the person who gave the problem votes for the best solution\t\t\t\u00a7 B) Scene painting, co-create solutions\t\t\t\u00a7 C) Scene painting, additionally with \"new choice\" keyword\t\t\u25cb Exchange facts \t\t\t\u00a7 In pairs: People share interesting facts regarding sustainability with each other\t\t\t\u00a7 Then groups of 4: select the most interesting of the 4 facts\t\t\t\u00a7 Then meet another group of 4 (--> 8 people), pick the most interesting fact of the two; then design a short art performance in 5 min\t\t\t\u00a7 Demonstrate the performance to the other groups and then explain briefly, 1 or 2 questions, then move on to next group\t\t\u25cb Debrief: reflection on and conclusions from workshop (in pairs)\t\t\u25cb Bonus (we skipped this part):\t\t\t\u00a7 Scene painting, with sustainability related images (\"I am a tree etc.\") (in groups of 6)\t\t\t\u00a7 Play an institution context (e.g. a cafe) in 3 variants (in groups of 6)\t\t\t\t\u25a1 A) horrible\t\t\t\t\u25a1 B) ok\t\t\t\t\u25a1 C) awesome",
