After that we discover the best (imho!) Android-based Free Software apps including methods of anonymization and encryption - and you will have the possibility to present your personal favorite Free Software app as well.\nAfter a short introduction about possible (non-existing) freedoms in Android & its Custom ROMs, we will discover F-Droid, the Free Software app repository and explore the functionalities and possible usage of its client with the same name.This F-Droid client is characterized by an anarchic design, it is resistant to censorship and surveillance and comes with a lot of emancipating features for its users. Unfortunately, it can be also a bit confusing in the beginning. This is where G-Droid comes in, a fork of the F-Droid client that can access the very same repository of Free Software apps while offering completely new qualities information management. Getting to know both of them and their respective benefits is first part of the workshop.In order to further make the first steps of discovering freedom on mobile phones a pleasant experience, some of the best (imho!) Free Software apps from F-Droid (the repository) will be presented in the second part of the workshop - as well as easy possibilities for enhanced anonymization and encryption.This is an interactive session for everyone! You can ask any question at any time and if I cannot help you someone else from the audience usually can.

GPL, AGPL, LGPL, MIT, Apache und hunderte mehr ... warum braucht Freie Software eigentlich Lizenzen und wir unterscheiden sie sich?

Und kann man damit Geld verdienen?Der Talk ist ein \"Foundation Talk\" und ist dazu gedacht den Zuh\u00f6renden einen leichten Einstieg in die Welt Freier Software zu erm\u00f6glichen. Im zweiten Teil werde ich einige der weitverbreitetsten Missverst\u00e4ndnisse zu Freier Software aufgekl\u00e4r, die sich schon seit Jahren halten und dadurch erschweren, m\u00f6glichst schnell das Potential Freier Software zu nutzen. Zum Beispiel a) Freie Software sei kostenlos, b) wer Freie Software \u00e4ndert, muss die \u00c4nderungen wieder allen verf\u00fcgbar machen und c) Freie Software ist (un)sicherer als propriet\u00e4re Software oder d) Freie Software ist das \u00fcberlegene Entwicklungsmodell. Oft h\u00f6rt man auch e) Freie Software bringe einem nichts, wenn man nicht selbst programmieren kann, und so weiter ...Dieser Foundation Talk ist auch dann richtig f\u00fcr dich, wenn Du Dich wunderst warum eine der Aussagen falsch sein soll oder Du Anregungen suchst, wie und was Du auf solche oder \u00e4hnliche Aussagen in Zukunft in unter zwei Minuten erwidern kannst.",

To achieve that, we build our own infrastructure (not relying on Google services) and use end-to-end encryption. Both come with their own set of challenges. For instance, we never used reCaptcha, but built our own captcha instead. For our Android app, we have replaced Firebase Push Notifications with our own system (which was a real challenge). The latest addition to our secure email service is an open source, zero-knowledge calendar. In this talk, I\u2019d like to explain how we handle the encryption so that it is 1. easy for the user, and 2. still so secure that only the user can access his data.

As more and more parts in an economy seem to become quantified and qualified, a new monitoring system for sustainable development will be installed. But how do people thought to measure sustainability?Starting in the 19th century with forest-management, we will talk about a systems perspective on sustainability, as well as the triple and quadruble bottom lines. While it is certain that we need to develop more sustainable computer systems, this is the time to talk about how we conceive sustainability and to reflect on what this will mean for future free software systems.Malte Rei\u00dfig is currently research associate at the Institute for Advanced Sustainability Studies e.V. and since 2008 free software developer with the dmx-platform \"for collaboration and knowledge management\".",

It is technically extensible, powered by Free Software, and Open Standards agreed independently by consensus.LinkedIn, Facebook, Google and others are racing to own the future of this space, with Gmail alone accounting for 28% of email opens in 2018, in Western countries.

With free documentation and free software, with using their devices in their own language, people may keep their language alive by contributing projects like Wiktionary and Wikisource.\n    In Turkey, along the Anatolia, more than 25 languages are spoken. As \u00d6zg\u00fcr Yaz\u0131l\u0131m Derne\u011fi (Free Software Association of Turkey), we wanted to translate our website and works to these Anatolian languages such as Kurdish, Zazaki, Lazuri, Homshetsi and so on. After we started conversations with culture institutes and associations from these folks, they replied as they are not able to use their devices with their own language. So now, we started a project with Anatolian minorities, we are translating and documenting GNU/Linux, GNOME, Firefox and LibreOffice (maybe Android/Replicant) to this languages, so with free software, these people can use computers and mobile phones with their own language. Also we are starting Wiktionary and Wikipedia ersions in these languages in order to keep these languages alive and compile the documents and publications in their language to make them documented well.     In this talk at 36C3,  we will tell a project in Turkey (a developing country which has no free software consciousness). In our project, Anatolian languages and minorities' cultures may be kept in the future. So many people uses proprietary software in their devices. These minorities are repressed to use their languages, not only their publication houses were closed by government, but also they were judged at \"National Security Courts\" in Turkey. With these assimilation policies, especially Lazuri and Homshetsi languages are imperilment right now, children are acquiring only Turkish as main tongue. Proprietary software and \"proprietarians\" are only seeking for profit, surveillance, and oppressing people's freedoms, so they are not able to use their devices with their own language. This situation makes the position of their languages much worse.    Free software and freedom philosophy gives a ray of hope to Anatolian minorities. With free documentation and free software, with using their devices in their own language, people may keep their language alive by contributing projects like Wiktionary and Wikisource.",

The anonymous creators suddenly stopped development in 2014 and warned about unfixed security issues, without further explanation. At the same time a donation-funded security audit was organized by cryptographer Matthew Green, which didn't find any serious issues. A fork of Truecrypt called Veracrypt is still developed today.The audit by the BSI was only recently revealed with a request according to the German freedom of information law. It contains information about bugs in the code that are present until today.The talk will present some of these findings and discuss the questionable role of the BSI.",

The idea is to deal with serious topics like the climate crisis in a playful way and share knowledge and ideas for change in the process. Maybe this contains some ideas that might inspire you. How the session will work: We will play and reflect on several improv exercises and games that link to sustainability. - Improv theater is basically theater without a script, with characters and stories created in teamwork between the actors.- You do not need to know anything about improv to attend, and we will try to make everyone feel safe and welcome.- Everyone can do this, you do not need to be particularly brave, spontaneous or creative :-)",

Because I have made the experience that especially in the social sciences and humanities there is hardly any technical interest, there is also little information about free software among fellow students. Therefore I would like to use the about:freedom space to introduce the tools I have used and exchange information about alternative software for academic use. I'm just finishing my sociology master's degree at Osnabr\u00fcck University and would like to become a journalist afterwards. Free Software has always been important to me since I've been using Linux for about ten years now and I'm always looking for new, useful software and try to share my knowledge for example at CryptoParties.",

After spending ten years building an open database to make this easy to check at the The Green Web Foundation, we are proposing a convention called carbon.txt, to decentralise this process. We have two goals:1) make it easier to make claims about how you power your infrastructure, by linking them to the certificates issued when renewable energy generation, like new wind farms and solar panels is attached to national grids.2) make it easy to verify claims made by others, by taking as many lessons from solving similar problems over the last 30 years of the internet, so you can follow a chain of provenance from a website or API, to the datacentre is uses, to the energy provider, to the energy certificates used to generate that powerWe are looking for collaborators to help develop the spec, implement tools against in different languages, and test it for common use cases.Chris Adams is an environmentally focussed tech generalist, spending the last ten years working in tech startups, blue chip companies and government, as a user researcher, product manager, developer, sysadmin and UX-er.He is an organiser of ClimateAction.tech, a community for technology professionals taking climate action, and a director of the Green WebFoundation.Martin Meyerhoff is a freelance software developer and coach with a background in public policy and administration, specialising in German climate policy.
